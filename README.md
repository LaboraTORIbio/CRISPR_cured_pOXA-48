# CRISPR_cured_pOXA-48

Code and bioinformatic methods for the manuscript:

Ariadna Fernandez-Calvet, Laura Toribio-Celestino, Aida Alonso-del Valle, Jorge Sastre-Dominguez, Paula Valdes-Chiara,  Alvaro San Millan, Javier DelaFuente. **The distribution of fitness effects of plasmid pOXA-48 in clinical enterobacteria.** 

* The bioinformatics workflow is described in the main file `CRISPR_cured_pOXA-48.md`
* Directory `analysis mutations/` includes the nucleotide sequences of sgRNAs and DNA enclosing mutations used to analyse possible off-target events, as well as the Needle alignment file. Also, the nucleotide sequences of the mutated genes/intergenic regions used for BLASTn searches against the NCBI database are provided in a FASTA file.
* Directory `figures_2&3/` includes necessary files and R scripts to generate Figures 2 and 3 of the manuscript, and statistical analyses of Figure 3.
